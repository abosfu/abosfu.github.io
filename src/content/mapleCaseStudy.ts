Overview

Air Canada is one of the largest airlines worldwide and a top carrier in North America, operating domestic and international flights daily. In 2024, Air Canada operated an average of 1,032 daily flights and welcomed over 47.3M passengers. The company reached C$22.255B in revenue in the last fiscal year, but faced a drop in profitability due to cost pressures—especially rising labour and pension expenses.

At the same time, customer experience challenges have remained visible: inconsistent on-time performance, record complaint volumes, and low customer satisfaction rankings relative to competitors. In response to these realities, Maple is proposed as an incremental innovation: an interactive support experience designed to reduce stress and friction during travel through real-time assistance, multilingual support, proactive updates, and airport navigation.

Goal: Maple is designed to support approximately 100,000 customers within the first month of launch, generating usage insights to identify which features provide the strongest impact and where to prioritize iteration.

Business Context

Air Canada serves 188 direct destinations worldwide, with major ports in Toronto, Montréal, and Vancouver. Its business spans passenger services, cargo operations, and a loyalty/vacation segment (Aeroplan and Air Canada Vacations), creating diversified revenue streams.

In 2024, Air Canada’s total operated capacity increased by 5.05% to 104.3B, alongside improved international expansion with new routes to destinations such as Singapore, Manila, and Madrid. Aeroplan grew its active membership base to over 9M, cargo revenue increased by 7.25%, and Air Canada Vacations expanded travel packages to new regions.

Financially, Air Canada reported C$22.255B in revenue (up from C$21.833B in 2023), with operating income of C$1.263B, net income of C$1.720B, and adjusted EBITDA of C$3.586B. However, operating margin fell from 10.4% (2023) to 5.7% (2024) due to cost pressures. Wages, salaries, and benefits rose to C$4.88B in 2024 (a 23.39% increase from 2023), and pension costs increased to C$614M.

Despite the pressure, Air Canada remained financially resilient with C$9.154B in total liquidity, C$4.918B in net debt, and C$1.294B in free cash flow.

Problem Definition

Post-pandemic recovery created operational and customer experience strain. Several issues stand out:

1) Trust and reputation risk from prior chatbot failure

In 2022, Air Canada introduced an AI chatbot that provided incorrect instructions to a customer seeking a discounted fare. Air Canada chose not to honour what the chatbot promised, and the dispute escalated to a civil resolution tribunal, which ruled against Air Canada. The incident reflected a lack of due diligence and created reputational damage.

2) Poor on-time performance and disruption stress

Air Canada has struggled with consistent flight performance, with reports noting a significant portion of flights arriving late in recent years. Delays are costly financially and damaging to brand perception, and they amplify customer stress when communication is unclear or slow.

3) Customer service overload and long wait times

Air Canada faces record levels of customer complaints—averaging around 3,000 new complaints per month in 2024, creating a backlog approaching 60,000. Customers frequently cite long wait times to speak with a representative, especially during disruptions.

4) Low customer satisfaction

Air Canada ranks among the lowest in North America for customer satisfaction across cabin classes. Economy passengers, in particular, sometimes perceive the experience as closer to budget carriers than other full-service airlines.

Maple is positioned as an incremental, operationally grounded response: reducing avoidable friction, improving communication during disruptions, and supporting customers who need clarity quickly.

⸻

Goals

To track success and measure impact, Maple targets three goals:

Short-term goal 1

Successfully assist 100,000 customers through Maple in the first month of integration.
This measures adoption speed and early usefulness. After reaching this volume, feature usage can be analyzed to prioritize refinement.

Short-term goal 2

Increase overall ratings by 10% within 6 months of implementation.
With current overall ratings around 3/5, the target is to elevate customer satisfaction meaningfully (toward 4/5 or higher) by improving support quality and reducing service friction.

Long-term goal

Increase satisfaction with customer service while reducing customer stress.
After use, a short survey would capture experience feedback to identify recurring issues and guide iteration—supporting long-term reputation improvement and loyalty.

Tenets and Alignment (Why this fits Air Canada)

Air Canada’s tenets emphasize customer focus, safety and trust, and operational efficiency.

Maple aligns directly by:
	•	Designing around core passenger pains (clarity, speed, language, navigation)
	•	Treating trust and safety as foundational constraints (especially after the 2022 chatbot incident)
	•	Improving efficiency by reducing load on in-person and call centre systems for routine questions

⸻

User Research & Personas

Maple was designed around the needs of target personas such as:
	•	First-time traveller (Korie)
	•	Student explorer (Kai / consolidated persona)

Research insights were anchored in direct feedback (Appendix H), where:
	•	83% of participants expressed interest in using the innovation
	•	17% said they would use it for navigation/info but not for booking due to AI reliability concerns

Participants repeatedly valued:
	•	Faster support and reduced waiting
	•	Clear real-time updates
	•	Multilingual support
	•	Navigation tools that reduce confusion in airports

Concerns were consistent and important:
	•	Skepticism about AI accuracy during complex disruptions
	•	Discomfort with sensitive data handling (passport details, birthdays, addresses)
	•	Preference for human escalation when needed
	•	Reliability risks in low connectivity environments (airport Wi-Fi, lag)

Opportunity

The opportunity is practical and measurable: customers are frustrated by slow support during high-stress moments, and Air Canada’s customer service systems face heavy volume. Maple provides a realistic path to reduce avoidable congestion and improve experience without requiring a full operational overhaul.

Maple is not framed as a replacement for human service. It is a structured support layer that:
	•	Handles routine and repeat questions instantly
	•	Provides proactive and interactive updates during disruptions
	•	Reduces confusion inside airports through navigation assistance
	•	Expands accessibility through multilingual support

⸻

How Maple Works

Maple is proposed as an AI-assisted support experience integrated into Air Canada’s app and website.

The system provides:
	1.	Real-time chatbot support for common issues (gate info, baggage, check-in, flight updates)
	2.	Airport and transit navigation support including auto-generated street-view-style guidance
	3.	Verbal support for hands-free assistance
	4.	Multilingual support (French, Mandarin, Punjabi, etc.)
	5.	Interactive reminders and notifications where passengers can reply and chat instead of receiving passive messages
	6.	Flight booking, management, and support (noting user concerns around trust)
	7.	Custom itineraries partnered with Marriott for stress-reduced planning
	8.	Reduced dependency on traditional customer service for routine needs

Service Blueprint and Operations

Maple is intended to reduce friction across the travel journey by supporting customers where bottlenecks occur most often: disruptions, uncertainty, and navigation.

Operationally, Maple supports Air Canada by:
	•	Deflecting routine inquiries away from call centres and in-person counters
	•	Allowing service staff to focus on complex issues where human judgment is required
	•	Increasing transparency during disruptions through real-time updates and guided next steps
	•	Supporting diverse customer segments through multilingual communication

Maple’s development approach includes working with:
	•	Air Canada’s existing app development team
	•	Microsoft Azure AI services (“customizable APIs and models”)
	•	Eleken for interface design services to ensure usability and intuitive experience
	•	Bronson Consulting for AI ethics auditing to account for regulatory compliance and ethical impacts

Business and Financial Impact

Maple is positioned as a customer experience improvement that also strengthens operational efficiency.

1) Cost reduction through automation of routine interactions

Airline labour costs are rising, with global airline labour costs expected to rise by 7.6% in 2024, and the largest wage increases occurring among North American carriers.

By automating basic interactions—baggage inquiries, gate information, rebooking guidance, check-in help—Maple reduces the dependency on human agents for routine volume.

A comparable case referenced in the proposal: Klarna’s AI handled two-thirds of customer service interactions, supporting over 2.3M conversations and reducing the need for 700 agents, cutting support costs by 40%.

2) ROI and break-even expectations

According to the proposal’s financial analysis:
	•	Development cost: C$400,000
	•	Expected: ~200% ROI within the first year
	•	Break-even projected: within ~4 months
(See Appendix G for the financial details underlying this model.)

3) Revenue and retention upside

Improving customer service experience increases retention. A cited relationship in the proposal: a 5% improvement in retention can increase profits significantly. Even a small increase in returning customers at Air Canada’s scale can materially impact revenue.

4) Strategic fit for international and student demographics

Canada’s international student population reached close to 1,000,000 by end of 2024. Maple’s multilingual and navigation support provides accessibility to this long-term demographic, supporting stronger market reach and better experience for first-time travellers and newcomers.

5) Partnership expansion potential

Maple’s integration with Marriott and potential third-party services creates future partnership-driven revenue streams—expanding convenience while increasing revenue per user through cross-promotional experiences.

Competitive Landscape

Maple was benchmarked against airline chatbots already in the market:

KLM — BlueBot (BB)

BB supports flight bookings, travel info, and reservation management, mainly through Facebook Messenger. Maple extends beyond basic service by integrating into Air Canada’s app/website and adding airport navigation, verbal support, interactive updates, and expanded multilingual accessibility.

Singapore Airlines — Kris

Kris supports predefined queries (flight info, baggage policies, check-in instructions) through Facebook Messenger. Maple differentiates through interactive, real-time features like navigation guidance, two-way disruption communication, and hands-free support.

Air France — Louis

Louis focuses on baggage-related inquiries on Air France’s website. Maple is broader: navigation, real-time support, proactive updates, and multilingual accessibility—covering more travel pain points beyond baggage.

Overall positioning: Maple is framed as a more complete travel support layer, designed around real customer pain points and integrated into the primary Air Canada experience.

⸻

Risks, Constraints, and Trust Considerations

Maple explicitly acknowledges adoption risks and operational constraints:

Key risks
	•	Trust and accuracy concerns (especially during complex flight disruptions)
	•	Sensitivity around personal data handling (passport and identity details)
	•	Fear of public backlash if AI is perceived as collecting or mishandling data
	•	Reliability in airports with poor connectivity or app lag
	•	Need for human escalation when AI cannot resolve edge cases

Mitigation strategies reflected in research
	•	Provide a clear path to escalate to human support
	•	Limit AI involvement in sensitive workflows until reliability and trust are validated
	•	Maintain privacy handling transparency
	•	Ensure fast performance and stable experience
	•	Consider offline support or degraded functionality when connectivity is limited

This risk-aware stance is intentional: Maple is an incremental innovation designed to be adopted without repeating the mistakes of past chatbot implementations.

	•	Faster access to support
	•	Reduced uncertainty and confusion during travel
	•	Easier airport navigation (especially for first-time travellers)
	•	More inclusive experience through multilingual support
	•	Less anxiety through proactive reminders, updates, and clarity

For Air Canada
	•	Reduced congestion in service channels (counters and call centres)
	•	Improved customer service ratings over time
	•	Lower complaint volume and reputational improvement
	•	Efficiency gains by shifting routine load away from human agents
	•	Stronger loyalty through more predictable customer experience

⸻

What I Learned

Building Maple as a product concept reinforced several lessons about real-world product work:
	•	A “helpful” system must be trustworthy, not just feature-rich
	•	In high-stakes contexts (travel disruptions), reliability and escalation pathways matter as much as speed
	•	Customer experience improvements can be framed as operational improvements when aligned with cost drivers like labour pressure
	•	Research feedback should shape scope decisions (ex: many users want the navigation + updates, but are skeptical about AI handling booking and sensitive info)
	•	Incremental innovation can still be valuable when it solves high-frequency pain points in a grounded way
