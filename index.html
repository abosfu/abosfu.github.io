My commitment to service and community engagement shines through initiatives that support both the club and broader charitable efforts.</p>
    <p>In addition to university activities, I have taken a leadership role in the <strong>DSFC (Do Something For Community)</strong> organization. I have been actively involved in organizing annual iftar events at our local mosque. These events provide a welcoming space for those in need, offering a nutritious meal and a sense of community during the holy month of Ramadan. My role involves event planning, volunteer coordination, and community outreach, all aimed at fostering inclusivity and support within our community.</p>
